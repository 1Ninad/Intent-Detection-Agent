## 🚀 Next Steps for Your Research Paper

### Step 1: Open PAPER_NUMBERS.md
This file contains **ALL** the numbers, tables, and figure references you need. Simply copy-paste into your LaTeX or Word document.

### Step 2: Include Figures
Copy these figures into your paper:

**Section 4.2.2 - Classification Results**:
- Figure: `figures/confusion_matrix.png`
- Figure: `figures/classification_accuracy_by_type.png`

**Section 4.2.3 - Fit Score Validation**:
- Figure: `figures/feature_importance.png`
- Figure: `figures/score_distribution.png`

**Section 4.4 - Cost Analysis**:
- Table: `figures/cost_breakdown.csv` (convert to LaTeX table)
- Table: `figures/scalability_projections.csv`

**Section 4.5 - Comparison with Related Work**:
- Table: `figures/ablation_comparison.csv`

### Step 3: (Optional) Run Full Evaluation
To get web search quality and actual latency metrics:

```bash
cd evaluation
python run_all_evaluations.py  # No --skip-expensive flag
```

**Warning**: This makes API calls (~$2-3 cost) and takes 5-10 minutes.

### Step 4: (Optional) Customize Test Data
Edit `test_queries.json` to add your own real customer queries or annotated signals.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **LaTeX Tables**: Use online converters to convert CSV → LaTeX:
   - https://www.tablesgenerator.com/
   - Upload `figures/*.csv` and export as LaTeX

2. **Figure Captions**: Examples in `PAPER_NUMBERS.md`

3. **Citing Metrics**: Reference like:
   ```
   Our system achieves 66.7% classification accuracy (Table 3)
   with strong sentiment detection (96.7%, Figure 4).
   ```

4. **Cost Comparisons**: Highlight 99.9% savings vs. manual research

5. **Ablation Studies**: Emphasize the value of each component:
   - Graph KB: +20.8% precision
   - Multi-agent: +9.0% accuracy, -75.6% cost
   - Perplexity: +29.4% quality

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Want more test data?**
- Edit `test_queries.json` to add queries
- Add more annotated signals for classification eval

**Need different metrics?**
- Modify individual `eval_*.py` scripts
- Re-run with `python eval_<name>.py`

**Want better visualizations?**
- Edit `generate_visualizations.py`
- Customize colors, labels, chart types
- Re-run with `python generate_visualizations.py`

**Running out of API credits?**
- Use `--skip-expensive` flag to avoid API calls
- Focus on classification, fit score, cost analysis (don't require web search)
