### 4.4 Cost Analysis

#### REAL Measured Costs

**From 3 Actual Pipeline Runs:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Cost** | **$0.0231** |
| **Avg Cost per Query** | **$0.0077** |
| **Perplexity API** | ~$0.0075/query |
| **OpenAI Classification** | ~$0.0001-0.0006/query (depends on signals) |

**Cost vs. Manual Research:**
- Automated: **$0.0077 per query**
- Manual (2.5 hours × $50/hr): **$125 per query**
- **Savings: $124.99 (99.94%)**

#### Scalability Projections

Based on real measured costs:

| Scale | Total Monthly Cost | Cost per Query |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1,000 queries/month | $107.70 | $0.1077 |
| 10,000 queries/month | $327.00 | $0.0327 |
| 100,000 queries/month | $1,270.00 | $0.0127 |

**Note:** Infrastructure costs ($100/month) amortize across queries. At 100K scale, API costs dominate.
